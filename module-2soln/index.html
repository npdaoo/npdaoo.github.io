		<p class="name">Feeding technique</p>
		<p class="content">In this kind of feeding process , the edge of the microstrip patch is connected directly to a conducting strip. This feeding method offers the benefit that the conducting line can have the opportunity of engraved on same substrate of patch antenna providing a planar shape.</p>

		<p class="name">Coaxial probe feeding</p>
		<p class="content">The outside conductor of a coaxial connector attached at ground plane, while the inside is extends across the dielectric and is welded at the radiating element antenna.  However, the disadvantage of this technique is a difficult to model and produce Ã  narrow bandwidth.</p>

	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
		<p class="name">Aperture coupled feed</p>
		<p class="content">This type of feed technique , a microstrip feed line is separated by the ground plane to the radiating patch. The feed line and the radiating element is coupled  through an aperture  or a slot in the ground plane .  The variations in the coupling will depend of width and length of the slot to improve</p>
